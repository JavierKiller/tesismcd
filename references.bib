   abstract = {Background: Long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) window and door curtains alone or in combination with LLIN water container covers were analysed regarding effectiveness in reducing dengue vector density, and feasibility of the intervention. Methods: A cluster randomised trial was conducted in an urban area of Colombia comparing 10 randomly selected control and 10 intervention clusters. In control clusters, routine vector control activities were performed. The intervention delivered first, LLIN curtains (from July to August 2013) and secondly, water container covers (from October to March 2014). Cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline (February 2013 to June 2013), 9 weeks after the first intervention (August to October 2013), and 4-6 weeks after the second intervention (March to April 2014). Results: Curtains were installed in 922 households and water container covers in 303 households. The Breteau index (BI) fell from 14 to 6 in the intervention group and from 8 to 5 in the control group. The additional intervention with LLIN covers for water containers showed a significant reduction in pupae per person index (PPI) (p=0.01). In the intervention group, the PPI index showed a clear decline of 71% compared with 25% in the control group. Costs were high but options for cost savings were identified. Conclusions: Short term impact evaluation indicates that the intervention package can reduce dengue vector density but sustained effect will depend on multiple factors.},

   abstract = {Background:Despite doubts about methods used and the association between vector density and dengue transmission, routine sampling of mosquito vector populations is common in dengue-endemic countries worldwide. This study examined the evidence from published studies for the existence of any quantitative relationship between vector indices and dengue cases.Methodology/Principal Findings:From a total of 1205 papers identified in database searches following Cochrane and PRISMA Group guidelines, 18 were included for review. Eligibility criteria included 3-month study duration and dengue case confirmation by WHO case definition and/or serology.A range of designs were seen, particularly in spatial sampling and analyses, and all but 3 were classed as weak study designs. Eleven of eighteen studies generated Stegomyia indices from combined larval and pupal data. Adult vector data were reported in only three studies. Of thirteen studies that investigated associations between vector indices and dengue cases, 4 reported positive correlations, 4 found no correlation and 5 reported ambiguous or inconclusive associations. Six out of 7 studies that measured Breteau Indices reported dengue transmission at levels below the currently accepted threshold of 5.Conclusions/Significance:There was little evidence of quantifiable associations between vector indices and dengue transmission that could reliably be used for outbreak prediction. This review highlighted the need for standardized sampling protocols that adequately consider dengue spatial heterogeneity. Recommendations for more appropriately designed studies include: standardized study design to elucidate the relationship between vector abundance and dengue transmission; adult mosquito sampling should be routine; single values of Breteau or other indices are not reliable universal dengue transmission thresholds; better knowledge of vector ecology is required. © 2014 Bowman et al.},

Spearman's correlations of indices that considered larval or immature (larvae and pupae) numbers had a better relationship with immature abundance but this was not necessarily the case against adult abundance. To examine the robustness of the indices, data from 758 premises in Townsville, Charters Towers, Ravenswood, and Mingela were pooled and 30 random subsamples, each consisting of 50 premises were taken. After each subsample was taken, the premises selected were reintroduced into the original data bank of 758 premises, and therefore, were available for further selection, i.e., sampling with replacement. Indices were calculated for each of the 30 subsamples and the coefficients of variation of each index were estimated from these. The Breteau, Adult Productivity, House, and Adult density indices proved to have the smallest coefficients compared with index size. No alternate index was regarded as being superior to the Breteau, including the Adult Productivity Index measuring both container type frequency and immature density. For this reason and in view of the labor intensiveness of estimating immature indices that incorporate productivity, it is recommended that new and cost-effective methods of adult surveillance be pursued.},

  abstract  = {Entomological surveillance of Aedes mosquitoes is used for operational (and research) purposes to determine changes in geographical distribution, for monitoring and evaluating control programmes, for obtaining relative measurements of the vector population over time, and for facilitating appropriate and timely decisions regarding interventions. There are a number of methods for monitoring vectors (mostly Aedes aegypti) of arboviral diseases. However, the selection and use of a method requires a clear understanding of the surveillance objectives, the availability of skills and resources, and in some instances the level of infestation. Surveillance may serve to identify areas of high-density infestation or periods of increasing mosquito populations. In areas where the vector is no longer present, entomological surveillance is critical in order to rapidly detect new introductions, before they become widespread and difficult to eliminate. Monitoring of the susceptibility of the vector population to insecticide should also be an integral part of any programme that uses insecticides. Separate guidance on monitoring and managing insecticide resistance in Aedes populations can be found at http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/insecticide-resistance. This document describes selected sampling methods that can be used to conduct surveillance of Aedes mosquitoes, pupae and oviposition. It is intended for qualified entomologists at national and sub-national level who are responsible for the surveillance of local Aedes populations.},

Here, we compared the larval ecology, geographical distribution and degree of infestation of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Yaoundé, the capital city of Cameroon, and estimated their Stegomyia indices revealing a significant potential risk of arbovirus transmission. An entomological survey was conducted in April–May 2018 in a cluster of houses randomly selected. Each selected house was inspected, the number of inhabitants was recorded, and potential and positive containers for Aedes were characterized. Stegomyia and pupae-based indices were estimated. Overall, 447 houses and 954 containers were inspected comprising 10,801 immature stages of Aedes with 84.95% of Ae. albopictus and 15.05% of Ae. aegypti. Both species bred mainly in discarded tanks and used tyres, associated with turbid water and the presence of plant debris inside containers. Aedes albopictus was the most prevalent species in almost all neighbourhoods. The house index, Breteau index, and container index were higher for Ae. albopictus (38.26%, 71.81%, and 29.61%) compared to those of Ae. aegypti (25.73%, 40.93%, and 16.88%). These indices are high compared to the thresholds established by Pan American Health Organization and World Health Organization, which suggests a high potential risk of arbovirus transmission.</p>},

Oviposition trap collections were performed in urban, suburban, and rural habitats in both areas. Our hypothesis that the abundances and frequencies of occurrence of Ae. aegypti and Ae albopictus are affected in opposite ways by increasing urbanization was only partially supported. City, habitat, and their interaction significantly affected the abundance of both species. Cities with high abundance of Ae. aegypti also had a high abundance of Ae. albopictus. The two species were most abundant in the cities of Rio de Janeiro state and the lowest in Boca Raton. Habitat had a significant but opposite effect on the abundances of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. In general, Ae. aegypti was most prevalent in highly urbanized areas and Ae. albopictus in rural, suburban, and vegetated urban areas in Rio de Janeiro state and Florida. However, abundances of the two species were similar in most suburban areas. Analyses of frequencies of occurrence showed an unexpected high level of co-occurrence of both species in the same oviposition trap. Despite the different geographical origins of Ae. albopictus in Brazil and the United States, the habitats used by this recent invader are remarkably similar in the two countries.},

We undertook a comparative study in three Cameroonian towns (Sahelian domain: Garoua; equatorial domain: Douala and Yaoundé) in order to document infestation by the two species and their ecological preferences. High and variable levels of pre-imaginal Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus infestation were detected. Only Ae. aegypti was encountered in Garoua, whereas both species were found in Douala and Yaoundé, albeit with significant differences in their relative prevalence. Peridomestic water containers were the most strongly colonized and productive larval habitats for both species. No major differences in types of larval habitat were found, but Ae. albopictus preferentially bred in containers containing plant debris or surrounded by vegetation, whereas Ae. aegypti tended to breed in containers located in environments with a high density of buildings.

Today, this invasive species is present in almost all countries of the region, including the Central African Republic (CAR), where it was first recorded in 2009. As invasive species of mosquitoes can affect the distribution of native species, resulting in new patterns of vectors and concomitant risk for disease, we undertook a comparative study early and late in the wet season in the capital and the main cities of CAR to document infestation and the ecological preferences of the two species. In addition, we determined the probable geographical origin of invasive populations of Ae. albopictus with two mitochondrial DNA genes, COI and ND5. Analysis revealed that Ae. aegypti was more abundant earlier in the wet season and Ae. albopictus in the late wet season. Used tyres were the most heavily colonized productive larval habitats for both species in both seasons. The invasive species Ae. albopictus predominated over the resident species at all sites in which the two species were sympatric. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed broad low genetic diversity, confirming recent introduction of Ae. albopictus in CAR. Phylogeographical analysis based on COI polymorphism indicated that the Ae. albopictus haplotype in the CAR population segregated into two lineages, suggesting multiple sources of Ae. albopictus.

Yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and Zika are poorly controlled in Africa and often go unrecognized.

Here, we review available data on the distribution of each disease in Africa, their Aedes vectors, transmission potential, and challenges and opportunities for Aedes control. Data on disease and vector ranges are sparse, and consequently maps of risk are uncertain. Issues such as genetic and ecological diversity, and opportunities for integration with malaria control, are primarily African; others such as ever-increasing urbanization, insecticide resistance and lack of evidence for most control-interventions reflect problems throughout the tropics. We identify key knowledge gaps and future research areas, and in particular, highlight the need to improve knowledge of the distributions of disease and major vectors, insecticide resistance, and to develop specific plans and capacity for arboviral disease surveillance, prevention and outbreak responses.},

Dengue fever can be spread through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Knowledge related to larval habitat is very important to limit the spread of Dengue virus by reducing the population level of Ae. aegypti. This study aims to determine the potential for dengue virus transmission based on the Entomological Index and Maya Index. The study was conducted in 2 villages in Ternate City for 1 month. To calculate the entomological index value, it is done by observing the characteristics of the habitat, namely by observing the container that is the habitat of Ae. aegypti. The calculated parameters are Container Index (CI), Breteau Index (BI), House Index (HI), Density Figure (DF), and calculate the BRI and HRI values to determine the virtual index. Based on the results of the study, it is known that the entomological index value of Kalumata and North Mangga Dua villages is CI 20.71%, HI 84.0% and BI 361%, with the average DF being in the high category (DF = 7 and 9). The virtual nidex value is in the medium category, namely MI = 55%, with a large BRI value = 56% (high category) and HRI = 45.5% (medium category), meaning that Kalumata and North Mangga Dua villages have the potential for virus transmission to occur Dengue},
